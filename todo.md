# TODO

-   [ ] search should search entire library, not just tracks. artists, albums, playlists, etc. different headers for each type of result.
-   [x] on account page, toggleably add switches for different telemetry to send back to the jellyfin server (i.e., plays reporting)
-   [x] artist names should be clickable links that take you to the artist page, everywhere they appear
-   [x] persist the current playing track and position
-   [ ] change logo to a fermata symbol (𝄐)
-   [ ] when the sidebar is collapsed due to small screen, allow it to be expanded via button as an overlay instead of inline
-   [ ] when screen is narrow and search gets wrapped, make it full width
