# TODO

-   [x] add auto build and release pipeline to github actions workflows
-   [ ] search should search entire library, not just tracks. artists, albums, playlists, etc. different headers for each type of result.
-   [ ] on account page, toggleably add switches for different telemetry to send back to the jellyfin server (i.e., plays reporting)
-   [ ] artist names should be clickable links that take you to the artist page, everywhere they appear
