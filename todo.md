# TODO

-   [ ] when you start loading a track (for playback), if it's not cached, do the "spinner" loading progress indicator on the track scrub bar. until it's ready to play. (still not working)
-   [ ] cache eviction does not actually delete off disk, and we accumulate stuff on disk over time.
    -   [ ] cache max size (default to 500MB?)
    -   [ ] cache size reporting in settings should reflect on disk
    -   [ ] "clear cache" should delete files off disk.
    -   [ ] default is LRU cache eviction
        -   [ ] add right-click context menu on track/album/artist to "Make available offline" (pin to cache)
    -   [ ] add "Available offline" section to sidebar (Albums, Artists, Playlists, Tracks)
-   [x] appearance: add "compact" mode with less padding; three-way switch "Sardinemode" | "Comfortable" | "Spacious"
-   [ ] UI thrash: scroll gets janky again during updates (investigate repaint storms)
-   [ ] Tracks browse should load alphabetically so pagination doesn't fetch items above the viewport (? need to repro)
-   [ ] Tracks browse should include the alphabet scroller widget.
-   [ ] sidebar settings for inclusion should be indented the same as the sidebar itself
-   [ ] Android: generate app icons from `assets/logo_app_icon.svg`.
-   [ ] Android: media session + notification controls (play/pause/next).
-   [ ] play controls
    -   [ ] shuffle
    -   [ ] repeat queue / playlist
    -   [ ] repeat track
-   [ ] "now playing" full-screen expanded view that showcases the album art if you click the album art in the mini player.
-   [ ] add to the homepage a "Jump in" section that has cards for (independently) randomly selected album, artist, and track
