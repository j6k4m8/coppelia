# TODO

## Low Priority

-   [ ] add font selector to appearance settings
-   [ ] add auto build and release pipeline to github actions workflows
-   [ ] indicate how much cache / disk space is being used by cached media
-   [x] in appearance/themes, allow tracking the system theme which overrides the light-dark setting.
-   [x] "good evening {user}" should be "welcome back {user}", "good morning {user}", afternoon, and:
    -   [x] 4-6am: "Some early bird tunes"
    -   [x] 10pm-4am: "Late night vibes"
-   [x] bug: the library stats header say "1 artist". that's definitely wrong.
-   [ ] on all pages the "card" hero should be part of the scrollable area, not fixed at the top.
-   [ ] should be able to click to navigate artist and album from now playing
-   [ ] playlists on the homepage should have a circular play button on them for single click play
-   [ ] right click "Favorite" / "Unfavorite" on albums, artists, tracks. should hit jelly API and update UI accordingly. spinner while waiting for response.
-   [ ] togleably (in settings page), the cards on hero header sections should either (on) show the album art at full size, filling the card's height, or (off) show the album art as a small square thumbnail on the left side with text to the right (what it is currently).
-   [x] also change the settings page to have different tabs, for "Appearance" (will hold theme stuff, font stuff later), "Layout", "Cache", "Account"
-   [ ] left pane sidebar is too shy, hides on even relatively wide screens...
-   [x] get rid of the carets in the sidebar, they are unnecessary clutter. you can still click the titles to expand / collapse sections.
