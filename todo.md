# TODO

## Integrations

-   [ ] add AirPlay device picker + playback route integration (iOS/macOS)
-   [ ] add Chromecast support + cast-friendly stream URLs (Android)
-   [ ] CarPlay/Android Auto support? Is that a separate thing?

## Backlog

-   [ ] [BUG] Favorites → Artists view sometimes empty
-   [x] Gapless playback
-   [x] Smart Lists (local-only, not synced like playlists)
-   [x] Smart Lists: add album/artist scopes
-   [x] Smart Lists: add sidebar empty state and quick-create template picker
-   [x] Smart Lists: add per-list context menu (rename, duplicate, delete)
-   [x] Smart Lists: improve rule validation + input helpers (date/duration parsing)
-   [x] Download manager (per-item progress, prioritization, cellular rules)
-   [ ] Crossfade controls (requires dual-player mixing probably?)
